# TODO

1. Standardize means of plugging new commands into the bot for repeating every x minutes.
  - Via yml?
2. Look into sending message based on some checked-per-unit-time trigger
  - Probably easier than I think it is
3. Clean/enhance bot configuration in main.py?
  - it just doesn't look or feel good tbh.
